=== Synopsis

This plugin allows to add external, static documents in a new tab in node details. 

With the plugin, you configure one (or several) root directory where are located 
your documents, and if a node has one for it (based on a regex and its hostname or uuid), 
the document will be downloadable.  

== Documents name

The document name matching is done based on the hostname of the node or
its uuid (both will be tested), in LOWER cases. 

== Configuration

The configuration file for the plugin is located at: TODO. 

Example: see TODO

The format allow to declare as many base directory you want. 

This is an example for a "security" report:

    security {
      title=Security Report
      description=This report display pen test results
      dirname=/tmp/security
      filename=@@node@@.html
      content-type=text/html
    }

- "security" is a unique key (only used internally)
- "title" is the name of section in the exeternal document tab
- "dirname" is the basedirectory on the local file system where documents are stored
- "description" is a description for what the document is about
- "filename": the file template name to lookup the document name. @@node@@ will
              be replaced by the node hostname and uuid. 
- "content-type": the HTTP content type to use for the new page. It allows to 
                 direct what the browser will do (open a PDF viewer, display 
                 an HTML page, etc).
